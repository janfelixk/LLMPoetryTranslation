Kindle the Christmas brand , and then
Till sunset let it burn ;
Which quench 'd , then lay it up again ,
Till Christmas next return .
Part must be kept , wherewith to teend
The Christmas log next year ;
And where ‘ tis safely kept , the fiend
Can do no mischief there .

I held Love 's head while it did ache ;
But so it chanced to be ,
The cruel pain did his forsake ,
And forthwith came to me .
Ai me ! how shall my grief be still 'd ?
Or where else shall we find
One like to me , who must be kill 'd
For being too-too-kind ?

I held Love 's head while it did ache ;
But so it chanc 'd to be ,
The cruel pain did his forsake ,
And forthwith came to me .
Ay me ! how shall my grief be still 'd ?
Or where else shall we find
One like to me , who must be kill 'd
For being too-too kind ?

What ! can my Kellam drink his sack
In goblets to the brim ,
And see his Robin Herrick lack ,
Yet send no bowls to him ?
For love or pity to his muse ,
That she may flow in verse ,
Contemn to recommend a cruse ,
But send to her a tierce .

<5>

6 [ Let sinners and their wicked rage
Be humbled to the dust ;
Shall not the God of truth engage
To vindicate the just ?
7 He knows the heart , he tries the reins ,
He will defend th ’ upright :
His sharpest arrows he ordains
Against the sons of spite .
8 For me their malice digg 'd a pit ,
But there themselves are cast ;
My God makes all their mischief light
On their own heads at last . ]
9 That cruel persecuting race
Must feel his dreadful sword ;
Awake , my soul , and praise the grace
And justice of the Lord .

<6>

Have you not seen the timid tear ,
Steal trembling from mine eye ?
Have you not marked the flush of fear ,
Or caught the murmured sigh ?
And can you think my love is chill ,
Nor fixt on you alone ?
And can you rend , by doubting still ,
A heart so much your own ?
To you my soul 's affections move ,
Devoutly , warmly true ;
My life has been a task of love ,
One long , long thought of you .
If all your tender faith be o'er ,
If still my truth you 'll try ;
Alas , I know but one proof more —
I 'll bless your name , and die !

<7>

Put off the vestal Veil , nor , oh !
Let weeping angels View it ;
Your cheeks belie its virgin snow .
And blush repenting through it .
Put off the fatal zone you wear ;
The shining pearls around it
Are tears , that fell from Virtue there ,
The hour when Love unbound it .

The harp that once thro ’ Tara 's halls
The soul of music shed ,
Now hangs as mute on Tara 's walls .
As if that soul were fled .—
So sleeps the pride of former days ,
So glory 's thrill is o'er ,
And hearts , that once beat high for praise ,
Now feel that pulse no more .
No more to chiefs and ladies bright
The harp of Tara swells ;
The chord alone , that breaks at night ,
Its tale of ruin tells .
Thus Freedom now so seldom wakes ,
The only throbs she gives ,
Is when some heart indignant breaks .
To show that still she lives .

<9>

The man , in life wherever plac 'd ,
Hath happiness in store ,
Who walks not in the wicked 's way ,
Nor learns their guilty lore !
Nor from the seat of scornful pride
Casts forth his eyes abroad ,
But with humility and awe
Still walks before his GOD .
That man shall flourish like the trees
Which by the streamlets grow ;
The fruitful top is spread on high ,
And firm the root below .
But he whose blossom buds in guilt
Shall to the ground be cast ,
And , like the rootless stubble , tost
Before the sweeping blast .
For why ? that GOD the good adore
Hath giv'n them peace and rest ,
But hath decreed that wicked men
Shall ne'er be truly blest .

<10>

1 Let us unfold God 's holy book ,
And by the taper 's light ,
With hearts subdued , and sober look ,
So spend the Sabbath night .
2 Where now the thoughts of anxious life ,
Its guilty pleasures , where ?
Here dies its loud and mourning strife ,
And all its sounds of care .
3 Let other views our hearts engross ,
To our Redeemer true ,
Who seems expiring on the cross ,
To say , I died for you !

<11>

The friendly cow all red and white ,
I love with all my heart :
She gives me cream with all her might ,
To eat with apple-tart .
She wanders lowing here and there ,
And yet she cannot stray ,
All in the pleasant open air ,
The pleasant light of day .
And blown by all the winds that pass
And wet with all the showers ,
She walks among the meadow grass
And eats the meadow flowers .

<12>

We doubt the word that tells us : Ask ,
And ye shall have your prayer ;
We turn our thoughts as to a task ,
With will constrained and rare .
And yet we have ; these scanty prayers
Yield gold without alloy :
O God ! but he that trusts and dares
Must have a boundless joy .

<13>

When first in CELIA 'S ear I poured
A yet unpractised pray'r ,
My trembling tongue sincere ignored
The aids of “ sweet ” and “ fair . ”
I only said , as in me lay ,
I 'd strive her “ worth ” to reach ;
She frowned , and turned her eyes away ,—
So much for truth in speech .
Then DELIA came . I changed my plan ;
I praised her to her face ;
I praised her features ,— praised her fan ,
Her lap-dog and her lace ;
I swore that not till Time were dead
My passion should decay ;
She , smiling , gave her hand , and said
‘ Twill last then — for a DAY .

<14>

I knew not ‘ twas so dire a crime
To say the word , “ Adieu ; ”
But this shall be the only time
My lips or heart shall sue .
That wild hill-side , the winter morn ,
The gnarled and ancient tree ,
If in your breast they waken scorn ,
Shall wake the same in me .
I can forget black eyes and brows ,
And lips of falsest charm ,
If you forget the sacred vows
Those faithless lips could form .
If hard commands can tame your love ,
Or strongest walls can hold ,
I would not wish to grieve above
A thing so false and cold .
And there are bosoms bound to mine
With links both tried and strong :
And there are eyes whose lightning shine
Has warmed and blest me long :
Those eyes shall make my only day ,
Shall set my spirit free ,
And chase the foolish thoughts away
That mourn your memory .

<15>

1 Too late , alas ! I must confess ,
You need not arts to move me ;
Such charms by nature you possess ,
‘ Twere madness not to love ye .
2 Then spare a heart you may surprise ,
And give my tongue the glory
To boast , though my unfaithful eyes
Betray a tender story .

<16>

We doubt the word that tells us : Ask ,
And ye shall have your prayer ;

With will constrained and rare .
And yet we have ; these scanty prayers
Yield gold without alloy :

Must have a boundless joy !

The friendly cow , all red and white ,
I love with all my heart :
She gives me cream with all her might ,
To eat with apple-tart .
She wanders lowing here and there ,
And yet she cannot stray ,
All in the pleasant open air ,
The pleasant light of day ;
And blown by all the winds that pass ,
And wet with all the showers ,
She walks among the meadow grass
And eats the meadow flowers .

<18>

A little while ago I caught ,
In cadence pure and clear ,
A waft of faintest music , wrought
Upon my inner ear .
A part of some elusive theme
Whose sweetly solemn air
My soul had harkened in a dream ,
I know not when nor where .
I only know my heart-strings stirred
With strange , forgotten pain ,
That crept upon me as I heard
That unremembered strain .
A sense of loneliness untold ,
So boundless , deep , unknown ,
I blindly reached my hands to hold
Your palms within my own !

<19>

AH , from the niggard tree of Time
How quickly fall the hours !
It needs no touch of wind or rime
To loose such facile flowers .
Drift of the dead year 's harvesting ,
They clog to-morrow 's way ,
Yet serve to shelter growths of spring
Beneath their warm decay ,
Or , blent by pious hands with rare
Sweet savours of content ,
Surprise the soul 's December air
With June 's forgotten scent .

<20>

Into the boat the breeze blows fair ,
It blows across the deck ;
It blows the little children 's hair ,—
They get it in the neck .
And in this picture you may see
The happy girls and boys ,
So true to life ,— but thankful be
You cannot hear the noise .
The great steam-whistle 's fearful squeaks .
The band , ill-tuned and loud ;
The babies with their screams and shrieks ,
The bustle of the crowd .
Grown People , you 'd prefer , afloat ,
A private yacht , I 'm sure ;
Then shun the gay excursion boat
Unless you 're very poor .

<21>

I value more than I despise
My tendency to sin ,
Because it helps me sympathise
With all my tempted kin .
He who has nothing in his soul
That links him to the sod ,
Knows not that joy of self-control
Which lifts him up to God .
And I am glad my heart can say ,
When others trip and fall
( Although I safely passed that way ) ,
‘ I understand it all . ’

<22>

I let them call it just The Wind ,
And tell me not to grieve .
But I know all it left behind ,
And more than they believe .
I know ; about the far-off lands ,
Where people never sleep ;
They hide their faces in their hands ,
And rock , and weep , and weep .
And I too little , all alone ,
To go and find them yet ;—
But Oh , I hear !— When I am grown ,
I never will forget .

<23>

The draft of love was cool and sweet
You gave me in the cup ,
But , ah , love 's fire is keen and fleet ,
And I am burning up .
Unless the tears I shed for you
Shall quench this burning flame ,
It will consume me through and through ,
And leave but ash — a name .

<24>

I call my years back , I , grown old ,
Recall them day by day ;
And some are dressed in cloth o ’ gold
And some in humble grey .
And those in gold glance scornfully
Or pass me unawares ;
But those in grey come close to me
And take my hands in theirs .

<25>

Base man ! and couldst thou think Cato alone
Wants courage to be dry ? and but him , none ?
Look 'd I so soft ? breath 'd I such base desires ,
Not proof against this Lybic sun 's weak fires ?
That shame and plague on thee more justly lie !
To drink alone , when all our troops are dry .
For with brave rage he flung it on the sand ,
And the spilt draught suffic 'd each thirsty band

<26>

TWO lawyers to their cause so well adhered ,
A country justice quite confused appeared ,
By them the facts were rendered so obscure
With which the truth remained he was not sure .
At length , completely tired , two straws he sought
Of diff'rent lengths , and to the parties brought .
These in his hand he held :— the plaintiff drew
( So fate decreed ) the shortest of the two .
On this the other homeward took his way ,
To boast how nicely he had gained the day .
THE bench complained : the magistrate replied
Do n't blame I pray — ‘ tis nothing new I 've tried ;
Courts often judge at hazard in the law ,
Without deciding by the longest straw .

<27>

Poor trembling soul within this frame of clay ,
That vainly questioneth , wouldst fain essay
The problem that nor time nor man may solve ,
Around which cycles evermore revolve !
Not till the light upon thy quest is born ,
That only beams in an immortal morn ,
Shalt thou be satisfied , thy fears allayed ,
And , freed from earth , a new creation made !

<28>

No , no , the falling blossom is no sign
Of loveliness destroy 'd and sorrow mute ;
The blossom sheds its loveliness divine ; -
Its mission is to prophecy the fruit .
Nor is the day of love for ever dead ,
When young enchantment and romance are gone ;
The veil is drawn , but all the future dread
Is lightened by the finger of the dawn .
Love moves with life along a darker way ,
They cast a shadow and they call it death :
But rich is the fulfilment of their day ;
The purer passion and the firmer faith .

<29>

When you and I have played the little hour ,
Have seen the tall subaltern Life to Death
Yield up his sword ; and , smiling , draw the breath ,
The first long breath of freedom ; when the flower
Of Recompense has fluttered to our feet ,
As to an actor 's ; and the curtain down ,
We turn to face each other all alone —
Alone , we two , who never yet did meet ,
Alone , and absolute , and free : oh , then ,
Oh , then , most dear , how shall be told the tale ?
Clasped hands , pressed lips , and so clasped hands again ;
No words . But as the proud wind fills the sail ,
My love to yours shall reach , then one deep moan
Of joy ; and then our infinite Alone .

<30>

The sea is just a cradle wide and deep ,—
A cradle that the moon rocks to and fro ;
What peace they find who there fall fast asleep ,
What lovely dreams ,— ‘ Tis not for us to know .
But God hath sent the angel of the sea
To sing to them an endless lullaby ;
And that they may not dread night 's mystery ,
He lights for them the candles of the sky .
They are infolded by the silken waves ,
And wrapped in shining blue , and emerald green ;
They drift through opalescent ocean caves ,
That only God Himself hath ever seen .
The great salt wind that no man holds in thrall ,
Touches them softly , as it passes by ;—
I think the silver sea gulls know them all ,
And greet them with their lonely tender cry .
For but a little little round of years ,
The sweet sun-sprinkled foam will be their bed ,
And they will slumber — hushed from any fears —
To waken , when the sea gives up her dead .
