<1>

Thou hast invoked me from my grave ,
And through thy magic spell
Hast quickened me with fierce desire ,
This flame thou canst not quell .
Oh press thy lips against my lips ,
Divine is mortal breath ;
I drink thy very soul from thee .
Insatiable is death .

<2>

1 Dear Mary , if thy little bird
Should , all the winter long ,
Pleased from the window to be heard ,
Repay thee with a song ;
2 A lesson let it still convey
To all with sense endued ;
And such the voice , oh ! let it say ,
The still small voice of love .

<3>

Do you remember , little cloud ,
This morning when you lay —
A mist along the river — what
The waters had to say ?
And how the many-coloured flowers
That on the margin grew ,
All promised when the day was done
To leave their tints to you ?

<4>

THE sun was shining calm and bright ,
The meadow grass was deep ;
The daisies and the buttercups
Were nodding , half-asleep .
And overhead the sparrows sat
And crooned upon the bough ,
And all the world was sleepy then ,
When Johnny drove the cow .
The sun was like a flaming beast ,
The field was like the sea ;
The grass like angry snakes did hiss
And wriggle at his knee .
The sparrows turned to goblin imps
That yelled , and fluttered on ,
As through a world , gone raving mad ,
The cow was driving John !

<5>

Oh , dear to old Dunolly 's heart
His darling daughter seemed ,
Yet when she fled , how pitiless
His bitter curse was deemed .
To death he doomed her lover true ,
And swore his lowly blood
Should stain the land , whose soil would blush
At wanton womanhood .
But leaves were thick , and woods were green ,
Where summer saw their love ,
And none could tell Dunolly where
Was nesting his wild dove .
Two years had sped , and all unchanged
Dunolly 's mood remained ;
When tired with hunting , late at eve
A forest hut he gained .
A cheerful scene ! for hung on trees
On either side the door
A stag and roe , and salmon there
Lay strewn the hut before .
There pausing silently he heard
Light laughter , O well known ;
And , looking through the wattled wall
Stood motionless as stone .
He saw a happy woman lie
Her true man 's form beside ;
And laugh as on the bed they tossed
A smiling child in pride .
No word Dunolly spoke , but went ,
An altered man , and said ;
“ Go bring them home , for rich are they ,
Love shows them nobly wed . ”

<6>

I hide myself within my flower ,
That wearing on your breast ,
You , unsuspecting , wear me too —
And angels know the rest .
I hide myself within my flower ,
That , fading from your vase ,
You , unsuspecting , feel for me
Almost a loneliness .

<7>

I felt a clearing in my mind
As if my brain had split ;
I tried to match it , seam by seam ,
But could not make them fit .
The thought behind I strove to join
Unto the thought before ,
But sequence ravelled out of reach
Like balls upon a floor .

<8>

It dropped so low in my regard
I heard it hit the ground ,
And go to pieces on the stones
At bottom of my mind ;
Yet blamed the fate that fractured , less
Than I reviled myself
For entertaining plated wares
Upon my silver shelf .

<9>

Veil not thine eyes , nor close thy lips ,
Nor speak with bated breath ;
This evil shall not always last ,
The end of it is death .
Avert the doom that crime must bring
Upon a guilty land ;
Strong in the strength that God supplies ,
For truth and justice stand .
For Christless men , with reckless hands ,
Are sowing round thy path
The tempests wild that yet shall break
In whirlwinds of God 's wrath .

<10>

He stood before my heart 's closed door ,
And asked to enter in ;
But I had barred the passage o'er
By unbelief and sin .
He came with nail-prints in his hands ,
To set my spirit free ;
With wounded feet he trod a path
To come and sup with me .
He found me poor and brought me gold ,
The fire of love had tried ,
And garments whitened by his blood ,
My wretchedness to hide .
The glare of life had dimmed my eyes ,
Its glamour was too bright .
He came with ointment in his hands
To heal my darkened sight .

<11>

To comfort hearts that sigh and break ,
To dry the falling tear ,
Wilt thou forego the music sweet
Entrancing now thy ear ?
I must return , I firmly said ,
The strugglers in that sea
Shall not reach out beseeching hands
In vain for help to me .
I turned to go ; but as I turned
The gloomy sea grew bright ,
And from my heart there seemed to flow
Ten thousand cords of light .
And sin-wrecked men , with eager hands
Did grasp each golden cord ;
And with my heart I drew them on
To see my gracious Lord .
Again I stood beside the gate .
My heart was glad and free ;
For with me stood a rescued throng
The Lord had given me .

<12>

“ The chimes ! the chimes ! ” the old man cried ,
“ I hear their tones at last ; ”
A sudden rapture filled his heart ,
And all his cares were past .
Yes , peace had come with death 's sweet calm ,
His journeying was o'er ,
The weary , restless wanderer
Had reached the restful shore .
It may be that he met again ,
Enfolded in the air ,
The dear old chimes beside the gates
Where all is bright and fair ;
That he who crossed and bowed his head
When Angelus was sung
In clearer light touched golden harps
By angel fingers strung .

<13>

My house is red — a little house ,
A happy child am I ,
I laugh and play the livelong day
I hardly ever cry .
I have a tree , a green , green tree ,
To shade me from the sun ;
And under it I often sit ,
When all my work is done .
My little basket I will take ,
And trip into the town ;
When next I 'm there I 'll buy some cake ,
And spend my bright half-crown .

<14>

HE lived amidst th ’ untrodden ways
To Rydal Lake that lead ;
A bard whom there was none to praise
And very few to read .
Behind a cloud his mystic sense ,
Deep hidden , who can spy ?
Bright as the night when not a star
Is shining in the sky .
Unread his works — his “ Milk White Doe ”
With dust is dark and dim ;
It 's still in Longmans ’ shop , and oh !
The difference to him .

O happy time of fleecy rime
And falling flakes , and O
The glad surprise in baby eyes
That never saw the snow !
Down shining ways the flying sleighs
Go jingling by , and see !
Beside the gate the horses wait
And neigh for you and me !

<16>

THY span of life was all too short —
A week or two at best —
From budding-time , through blossoming ,
To withering and rest .
Yet compensation hast thou — aye !—
For all thy little woes ;
For was it not thy happy lot
To live and die a rose ?

<17>

I see fair women all the day ,
They pass and pass — and go ;
I almost dream that they are shades
Within a shadow-show .
Their beauty lays no hand on me ,
They talk — -I hear no word ;
I ask my eyes if they have seen ,
My ears if they have heard .
For why — within the north countree
A little maid , I know ,
Is waiting through the days for me ,
Drear days so long and slow .

<18>

Like sea-washed sand upon the shore ,
So fine and clean the tale ,
So clear and bright I almost see ,
The flashing of a sail .
The tang of salt is in its veins ,
The freshness of the spray
God give you love and lore and strength ,
To give us such alway .

<19>

I heard you singing in the grove ,
My Lady Nightingale ;
The thirsty leaves were drinking dew ,
And all the sky was pale .
A silence — clear as bells of peace
Your song thrilled on the air ,
Each liquid note a thing of joy ,
And sweet beyond compare .
Not all of joy — a haunting strain
Of sorrow and of tears ,
A note of grief which seemed to voice
The sadness of the years .
‘ Twas pure , ‘ twas clear , ‘ twas wondrous sweet ,
My Lady Nightingale ,
Yet subtly sad , the song you sang
When all the sky was pale .

<20>

Love lit a beacon in thine eyes ,
And I out in the storm ,
And lo ! the night had taken wings ;
I dream me safe and warm .
Love lit a beacon in thine eyes ,
A wreckers ’ light for me ;
My heart is broken on the rocks ;
I perish in the sea .

<21>

It may be that your eyes deceive you slightly ;
Naught but a plain black poodle do I see .
It seems to me that with enchanted cunning
He snares our feet , some future chain to bind .

<22>

How kindly thou my yearning then didst still
With gentle words , enthralling me to thee .
In truth methought I read thy whispers mild
Wherewith thou lovingly my soul didst fill ,
E'en to myself for aye ennobling me .

<23>

But we are on the proper road alone !
If gladly is to thaw the frozen soul ,
The fire of love must aye be kept alive .

<24>

This is not then thy grief , to see me die ?
Die shalt thou not , yet give thy blood to death .

<25>

Firm let it stand whatever bleed or fall .
O Gods , that I should say it shall and weep .

<26>

What stain is on them for thy tears to cleanse ?
A stain of blood unpurgeable with tears .

<27>

Yea ! I regret those hours I wasted on
The poor procession that preceded thee .
Hadst thou come first , then all the added wealth
Of one long day of loving thee were mine -
A boundless fortune squandered . Though I live
To three score years and ten , as I do hope ,
In wedded love beside thee , that one day
Was filched from me and cannot be restored .

<28>

I am more tremulous than shaken reeds ,
And love has made me like the river water .
Thy voice is as the hill-wind over me ,
And all my changing heart gives heed , my lover .
Before thy least lost murmur I must sigh , 
Or gladden with thee as the sun-path glitters .

<29>

Hagbert , remember , was hanged to a tree .
Who can be taken , to hang has consented .

<30>
1 Do you not know , not a fortnight ago ,
How they bragg 'd of a Western Wonder ?
When a hundred and ten slew five thousand men ,
With the help of lightning and thunder ?
2 There Hopton was slain , again and again ,
Or else my author did lie ;
With a new thanksgiving , for the dead who are living ,
To God , and his servant Chidleigh .
3 But now on which side was the miracle tried ?
I hope we at last are even ;
For Sir Ralph and his knaves are risen from their graves ,
To cudgel the clowns of Devon .
4 And there Stamford came , for his honour was lame
Of the gout three months together ;
But it proved , when they fought , but a running gout ,
For his heels were lighter than ever .
5 For now he outruns his arms and his guns ,
And leaves all his money behind him ;
But they follow after ; unless he take water ,
At Plymouth again they will find him .
6 What Reading hath cost , and Stamford hath lost ,
Goes deep in the sequestrations ;
These wounds will not heal , with your new great seal ,
Nor Jephson 's declarations .
7 Now , Peters and Case , in your prayer and grace ,
Remember the new thanksgiving ;
Isaac and his wife , now dig for your life ,
Or shortly you 'll dig for your living .
