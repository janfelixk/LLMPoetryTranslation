Oh , do not look so bright and blest ,
For still there comes a fear ,
When brow like thine looks happiest ,
That grief is then most near .
There lurks a dread in all delight ,
A shadow near each ray ,
That warns us then to fear their flight ,
When most we wish their stay .
Then look not thou so bright and blest ,
For ah ! there comes a fear ,
When brow like thine looks happiest ,
That grief is then most near .
Why is it thus that fairest things
The soonest fleet and die ?—
That when most light is on their wings ,
They 're then but spread to fly !
And , sadder still , the pain will stay —
The bliss no more appears ;
As rainbows take their light away ,
And leave us but the tears !
Then look not thou so bright and blest ,
For ah ! there comes a fear ,
When brow like thine looks happiest ,
That grief is then most near .

<2>

Nay , sweet the shore , and sweet the song ,
And dear the languid dream ;
The music mingled all day long
With paces of the dancing throng ,
And murmur of the stream .
An hour ago , an hour ago ,
We rested in the shade ;
And now , why should we seek to know
What way the wilful waters flow ?
There is no fairer glade .

<3>

My greatest grief is not my own ;
That often proves a blessing ,
For in my grief God 's care is shown ,
And as I am not left alone ,
It never proves distressing ;
But when my brother 's grief I bear
The weight then seems excessive ;
His heavy load I inly share ,
And loaded down by double care ,
My burden feels oppressive .
Yet I remember Him who bore
The world 's great load of sorrow ,
And know that He on me will pour
The needed grace to bear the more ,
To-day and on the morrow .

<4>

He met her with her milking-cans ,
Too fast the moments speeded ,
For while they chat on this and that
My first may low unheeded .
And was she call ’ d a forward jade ,
And was he graceless reckon ’ d ,
Because he stopt the dairy-maid ,
Enchanted by my second ?
Though stars in thousands stud the pole ,
The fields own stars as yellow ,
And when I gave that last my whole ,
She thank ’ d a happy fellow .
But she was call ’ d a forward jade ,
And I was graceless reckon ’ d ;—
I only kiss ’ d that dairy-maid ,
Enraptur ’ d by my second .

<5>

A long , long sleep , a famous sleep
That makes no show for dawn
By stretch of limb or stir of lid , —
An independent one .
Was ever idleness like this ?
Within a hut of stone
To bask the centuries away
Nor once look up for noon ?

<6>

If life were but a dream , my Love ,
And death the waking time ;
If day had not a beam , my Love ,
And night had not a rhyme ,—
A barren , barren world were this
Without one saving gleam ;
I ‘ d only ask that with a kiss
You ‘ d wake me from the dream .
If dreaming were the sum of days ,
And loving were the bane ;
If battling for a wreath of bays
Could soothe a heart in pain ,—
I ‘ d scorn the meed of battle 's might ,
All other aims above
I ‘ d choose the human 's higher right ,
To suffer and to love !

A little saint best fits a little shrine ,
A little prop best fits a little vine :
As my small cruse best fits my little wine .
A little seed best fits a little soil ,
A little trade best fits a little toil :
As my small jar best fits my little oil .
A little bin best fits a little bread ,
A little garland fits a little head :
As my small stuff best fits my little shed .
A little hearth best fits a little fire ,
A little chapel fits a little choir :
As my small bell best fits my little spire .
A little stream best fits a little boat ,
A little lead best fits a little float :
As my small pipe best fits my little note .
A little meat best fits a little belly ,
As sweetly , lady , give me leave to tell ye ,
This little pipkin fits this little jelly .

<8>

In ruin are the spacious , splendid halls
With frozen forest of white columns where
The Tartar Khan his palace builded fair ,
Where loneliest the shrilling cricket calls .
The ivy blackens over shining walls
Enscribing in gigantic letters there
Some curse Belshazzar-like : Beware ! Beware !—
Then black as crepe from crested columns falls .
Within the burnished banquet room there sings
The fountain of the harem pure and clear ,
Just as of old it sang in twilights drear .
But whither love and fame speed — on what wings ?
When all things else must perish these endure !
Yet both are gone ! The fountain ripples pure .

<9>

‘ Tis thought Odysseus when the strife was o'er
With all the waves and wars , a weary while ,
Grew restless in his disenchanted isle ,
And still would watch the sunset , from the shore ,
Go down the ways of gold , and evermore
His sad heart followed after , mile on mile ,
Back to the Goddess of the magic wile ,
Calypso , and the love that was of yore .
Thou too , thy haven gained , must turn thee yet
To look across the sad and stormy space ,
Years of a youth as bitter as the sea ,
Ah , with a heavy heart , and eyelids wet ,
Because , within a fair forsaken place
The life that might have been is lost to thee .

<10>

O day , O day , is it a little thing
That thou so long unto thy life must cling ,
Because I gave thee such a welcoming ?
I called thee king of all felicity ,
I praised thee that thou broughtest joy so nigh ;
Thine hours are turned to years , thou wilt not die ;
O day so longed for , would that thou wert gone !

<11>

Why should I name the land across the sea
Wherein I first took hold on misery ?
Why should I name the land that flees from me ?
Let me depart , since ye are happy here .

<12>

What wilt thou do within the desert place
Whereto thou turnest now thy careful face ?
Stay but a while to tell us of thy case .
Abide ! abide ! for we are happy here .

<13>

What , nigh the journey 's end shall I abide ,
When in the waste mine own love wanders wide ,
When from all men for me she still doth hide ?
Let me depart , since ye are happy here .

<14>

Nay , nay ; but rather she forgetteth thee ,
To sit upon the shore of some warm sea ,
Or in green gardens where sweet fountains be .
Abide ! abide ! for we are happy here .

<15>

Will ye then keep me from the wilderness ,
Where I at least , alone with my distress ,
The quiet land of changing dreams may bless ?
Let me depart , since ye are happy here .

<16>

Ah ! with your sweet eyes shorten not the day ,
Nor let your gentle hands my journey stay !
Perchance love is not wholly cast away .
Let me depart , since ye are happy here .

<17>

Pluck love away as thou wouldst pluck a thorn
From out thy flesh ; for why shouldst thou be born
To bear a life so wasted and forlorn ?
Abide ! abide ! for we are happy here .

<18>

Dost thou believe that this shall ever be ,
That in our land no face thou e'er shalt see ,
No voice thou e'er shalt hear to gladden thee ?
Abide ! abide ! for we are happy here .

<19>

No longer do I know of good or bad ,
I have forgotten that I once was glad ;
I do but chase a dream that I have had .
Let me depart , since ye are happy here .

<20>

We mock thee not . Hast thou not heard of those
Whose faithful love the loved heart holds so close ,
That death must wait till one word lets it loose ?
Abide ! abide ! for we are happy here .

<21>

Come back ! like such a singer is the wind ,
As to a sad tune sings fair words and kind ,
That he with happy tears all eyes may blind !
Abide ! abide ! for we are happy here .

<22>

Oh , no ! not far thou heardest her , but nigh ;
Nigh , ‘ twixt the waste 's edge and the darkling sky .
Turn back again , too soon it is to die .
Abide ! a little while be happy here .

<23>

I BURIED Joy ; and early to the tomb
I came to weep — so sorrowful was I
Who had not dreamed that Joy , my Joy , could die .
I turned away , and by my side stood Joy
All glorified — ah , so ashamed was I
Who dared to dream that Joy , my Joy , could die !

<24>

I GIVE you Life , O child , a garden fair ;
I give you Love , a rose that blossoms there —
I give a day to pluck it and to wear !
I give you Death , O child — a boon more great —
That , when your Rose has withered and ‘ tis late ,
You may pass out and , smiling , close the gate !

<25>

With heart pain and with quiver of the lip ,
I bid my boy “ good bye , ” with words of cheer .
I hug him to my heart to hide a tear ,
And hold him close so long , that no tongue-slip
Could more betray my bodings for his ship ,
Or troop , when landed . It is when I hear
My daughters ’ voices , that I shame off fear
And take my boy 's both hands with firmest grip .
Go , son , and , though with thy young life ‘ tis blown ,
Blare thou the Bugle , rousing man to sweep
The monsters back to Hell 's profoundest deep ,
Where , mocking Spring and Sun-rise , they have grown
On longings for the sea , the world must weep
When , from its heart , the hope of Peace has flown .

<26>

It is too late to part . I dreamed a dream
That love had loosed me , that no more your name
Should vex my soul , for very pride and shame
I hid you out of mind ; I said , The stream
Has grown too wide between us , it would seem
To sunder even memory . Your fame
Rang hollow on my ear , and then you came
And love laughed for the lie he would redeem .
It is too late . Love will not let me go .
The bare suns burn me , and the strong winds blow ;
I take them fearlessly , for I am wise
At last ; for being yours I must be brave ,
Tho ’ you give nothing , still am I your slave ,
The light within my heart your eyes , your eyes .

<27>

Our deeds avail not ; and our dreams are thrust
Into the dark and wither from the sky .
We live in duress , and to sweetness die ;
And lo ! our guerdon is the world 's distrust .
Yet have we dreamt of judgment that is just ,
And seen a splendour trailing from on high ;
From mean abortion mounts our piteous cry :
“ Out of the dust , O Christ ! out of the dust ! ”
We are as leaves within the winter gale ,
And are through tribulation darkly driven ;
And all the promise that the prime hath given
Is as faint smoke before the winds that wail .
Wan from the drowning pools of bitter bale
Our futile faces front the hush of heaven !

<28>

We meet again beyond the barren past ,
Beyond the pride , the sorrows and the tears ;
And yearnings leave the strife and hate of years
To flood our souls with perfect peace at last !
Our hearts forget the wrong so deep and vast ,
The wounding words and all the cruel woe ,
Till joy is all our bounding bosoms know ,
And life is glad with happiness at last .
Love , deathless and forgiving , crowns with bays
The future and our hopes , as full of grace ,
As youth had fondly dreamed in other days ,
When first we knew how sweet was her embrace .
God 's endless purpose guides the feet of men ;
Beyond our pride we meet in love again !

<29>

However skilled and strong art thou , my foe ,
However fierce is thy relentless hate ,
Though firm thy hand , and strong thy aim , and straight
Thy poisoned arrow leaves the bended bow ,
To pierce the target of my heart , ah ! know
I am the master yet of my own fate .
Thou canst not rob me of my best estate ,
Though fortune , fame , and friends , yea , love shall go .

<30>

Though pent in stony streets , ‘ tis joy to know ,
‘ Tis joy , although we breathe a fainter air ,
The spirit of those places far and fair
That we have loved , abides ; and fern-scents flow
Out of the wood 's heart still , and shadows grow
Long on remembered roads as warm days wear ;
And still the dark wild water , in its lair ,
The narrow chasm , stirs blindly to and fro .
Delight is in the sea-gull 's dancing wings ,
And sunshine wakes to rose the ruddy hue
Of rocks ; and from her tall wind-slanted stem
A soft bright plume the goldenrod outflings
Along the breeze , above a sea whose blue
Is like the light that kindles through a gem .
